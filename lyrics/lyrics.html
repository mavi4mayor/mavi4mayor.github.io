        the difference between a nigga like me and a hundred million is a couple years <br />
        <br />
        had to knock the lining out her ribs to let some love in there <br />
        <br />
        i be justifying crises lived from writing couple hymns <br />

        <br />
        trauma i survived done left me planted aint no buckling<br />
        <br />
        bar was raised up high by all the xan and when my lover dipped<br />
        <br />
        i stay calm and guided thru the qualms to reach the subtle shit <br />
        <br />
        i still got anxiety your calls&rsquo;ll leave me tunneled in <br />
        <br />
        i got over lying underlying where my heart is <br />
        <br />
        i got puddled pride and troubled eyes cause i&rsquo;m an artist<br />
        <br />
        i been close to morgue underscoring where my mind was<br />
        <br />
        ive eloped before and other corny shit to find love <br />
        <br />
        ive bespoke and ive reproached the lord still tryna find bruh <br />
        <br />
        i done got some crazy ass results for showing kindness <br />
        <br />
        let the sun talk in love w light aubade bathing me<br />
        <br />
        administration meant for saving me act like they hating me<br />
        <br />
        stumbled into worlds of vacancy, i stayed to say the least<br />
        <br />
        crumbled spirit furled to make-believe tiptoeing flames beneath<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        i had to pick that up<br />
        eye had to shed that tear<br />
        i had to give that up<br />
        eye level led me here<br />
        sky level bred i&rsquo;m fallen<br />
        blind spots so all sights sealed<br />
        oh aight so now i get it<br />
        might pinch me now eyes peeled<br />
        i know my plate better not drove<br />
        eyesore that old ass tag<br />
        po me won&rsquo;t let that hold me back from toting my gas eyes swollen closing<br />
        &lsquo;i know you floating&rsquo; coldly mom dotes<br />
        i roll two rosy eyes<br />
        other than the odor of og smoke cloaked in lies<br />
        no surprise homie<br />
        the henny half shockingly get held down over than coke<br />
        eyes open close<br />
        what the fuck was i just poking oh no<br />
        beer goggles got my eyes pose like they broke<br />
        i know ima catch a sideye dashin out the door<br />

        newer glint in my eye another sunrise<br />

        another bum rhymer for lunchbox<br />
        i flubbed a couple tough trials<br />
        for this cumquat colored rough rider<br />
        bumped vials<br />
        nothing like the drugs i do<br />
        shorty was squeamish and intravenous<br />
        i was into keeping breathing room<br />

    <div class="break"> 
        sunbathing in the field<br />
        lungs making room for kills<br />
        unbreakable i&rsquo;m still but it feel different<br />
        <br />
        long day ahead at best<br />
        paul heyman with the check<br />
        caucasians made my presence a meal ticket<br />
        <br />
        <br />
        i be hanging on the edge<br />
        i be banking on my bed<br />
        sleeping teeter on the precipice still centered<br />
        <br />
        i been feeling like a giver<br />
        still won&rsquo;t tell her that i miss her<br />
        swear i need that lil kiss w the squeal with it<br />
        <br />
        we be hanging in the dark<br />
        we surprise em with the prowess<br />
        if it aint to give a spark we&rsquo;d be still hidden<br />
        <br />
        prone to languish in my scars<br />
        waste away when i&rsquo;m at howard<br />
        school a break and rip apart a whole lil village<br />
        <br />
        i can&rsquo;t pace it with this art<br />
        scraped a project off the bottom<br />
        made a painting of my heart w a lil filter<br />
        <br />
        i keep cadence w my heart<br />
        still alive defying logic<br />
        cost a payment up to god w a lil interest<br />
        <br />
        w a lil interest in the field<br />
        but it feel different<br />
        keep it real show me your real intentions<br />
        keep it sealed we still need a lil rinsing in the field but it feel different

    <h1 class="title">selflove</h1>
    <div class="break"> 
        peel in my second whip<br />
        stealing put second hand kills in my residence<br />
        healed all my brethren w a seal we can&rsquo;t let you in<br />
        medicine<br />
        put the effort in to still burn at effigy<br />
        odorous i&rsquo;m sober just as lil as they letting me<br />
        mama wipe your tears i&rsquo;m fighting titans can&rsquo;t invite you here<br />
        poetic license veering from the mike chest too tight to steer<br />
        chess lessons bloodletting flood when the night is clear<br />
        i ain&rsquo;t give a fuck till my lungs had to fight for air<br />
        glaring staring numb therapist had a life to spare<br />
        snatched me by the eye said ima fight whether i like or not<br />
        and she told me reasons why but that&rsquo;s the private part<br />
        burnt the midnight lighter<br />
        killed the drive in me to tie the knot<br />
        game slop but if i namedropped you u still got my heart<br />
        driving off squeezing off the e brake these days<br />
        i can&rsquo;t talk to god just for my knees sake<br />
        long conversations to be had<br />
        wrong places wrong times and<br />
        strong patience i must add<br />
        soul weighted don&rsquo;t mistake expatiations for some sadness<br />
        a strong face, a long race i&rsquo;m unafraid to come n last<br />
        quarter tank n ounce of gas and i&rsquo;m driving<br />
        <br />
        i&rsquo;m back at it glad bags and flat backs a pack rat<br />
        a crass habit crash flashing scratch that im past rapping ima show off<br />
        in a scar competition<br />
        flaunting close calls when you cook you can&rsquo;t regress back to the store bought<br />
        hope you keep me in mind that you i hope you shaking<br />
        i hope you keep analyzing hard as i make u<br />
        as hard as i make it love that i&rsquo;m armed with broad as it&rsquo;s brazen<br />
        arguing w mom cause i&rsquo;m always gone when i stay here<br />
        she said it&rsquo;s just because i love you<br />
        that i see you out here poisoning yourself and want it for you<br />
        and i love you better than i love myself my fruit is mine spoiled<br />
        and it&rsquo;s not a game i put it in your name i kinda told you<br />
        and i nodded and i took it to the chin and i deposit<br />
        and i dropped it and i looked into the mirror said omavi,<br />
        you coarser and you closer the rhythm that&rsquo;s inside<br />
        and i warped you in the interest of design<br />
        it&rsquo;s just because i love you<br />
        <br />
        clasp the windows to my soul<br />
        smoke thicken grab my mental by the throat<br />
        mind sifting tides shift it&rsquo;s still cement around my toes<br />
        saran wrap around my pack i can&rsquo;t trust get hand to hand served w a hand behind my back<br />
        they prayed for us, ain&rsquo;t heard the answer but my glance is in the stash<br />
        it&rsquo;s growing handsome by the stack i self aggrandized in the past but now the sun talking<br />
        unsure of where i&rsquo;m going but i&rsquo;m blunt walking<br />
        in life or in this hood so keep a look for 911 callers<br />
        i fund loss and i&rsquo;m from loss<br />
        u gut me then it&rsquo;s no love lost<br />
        you spun me into crumbles fingers numbing from the bloodloss<br />
        i&rsquo;ve endured<br />
        the moral of my story is i&rsquo;m impure<br />
        the horror in my story is ive been through it and i still do it and my pencil is in earnest the difference tween u
        hearing the new records from my service<br />
        the medicine i&rsquo;m burning turned my breath into a furnace<br />
        whole face hot<br />
        shoulders hold weight till i break pace and can&rsquo;t stop<br />
        so baby i could change your life, if you let me<br />
        tryna eat ain&rsquo;t really crave a bite since gained insight from desi<br />
        so i stay inside away from light<br />
        hoping that your prayers reach<br />
        croaking when i can&rsquo;t breathe<br />
        loathing that i can&rsquo;t speak<br />
        i was open with my grandscheme<br />
        you was either with me or in my way plow through standees<br />
        we sprouting now because we plant seeds<br />
        you plant love love will grow<br />
        you plant fear fear a grow<br />
        if you planted meter me would grow<br />
        but i was branded negro<br />
        i got slanted before relegated to preshow<br />
        i started w wine then to the clear then to the nino<br />
        then to everclear and never steering without preroll<br />
        and i just had the presets to preceptor me bro<br />
        i bleed presence<br />
        and preach lessons<br />
        all for free too<br />
        offer free smoke to all the niggas behind a me too<br />
        to my niggas: we ain&rsquo;t free until she free too<br />
        to my sisters: we ain&rsquo;t free until they free too

            and how my means end<br />
            and how i need friends<br />
            but hate niggas<br />
            <br />
            i been treading in the deep end<br />
            and ion need fins<br />
            cause when my feet hit the bottom i&rsquo;ll be cradled<br />
            i&rsquo;m a lazy motherfucker<br />
            either that or i&rsquo;m a workhorse<br />
            niggas want my waves but they need way bigger surfboards<br />
            niggas want a tape and they just preying on my hurt for it<br />
            drinking on the third floor to laying on the third floor<br />
            and laying in the dirt for this shit i swear i&rsquo;m willing<br />
            brave enough to search for the shit i know i&rsquo;m missing<br />
            craving for that hurt probably gon b my ending<br />
            tryna b the bridge between my father and my sister<br />
            tryna be the shit for a while for i&rsquo;m incinerated<br />
            <br />
            tryna be the kid for my mama she can feel elated<br />
            owe her cause she liberate me<br />
            know she see me in her face<br />
            know my brothers imitate me<br />
            though we in a different place<br />
            <br />
            dough i&rsquo;m out here for this money<br />
            can fail a million ways they still b dumb enough<br />
            or trusting enough to love me<br />
            swear i&rsquo;m so fucking lucky<br />
            still attribute it to talent cause i love the gluttony<br />
            i swear i love the fame<br />
            and i love the pride<br />
            just like i love the pain<br />
            and i love the ride 2x

            i already heard how niggas feel about my patnas<br />
            so it&rsquo;s awkward in person when ion give their sought acknowledgement<br />

            diamond from dallas i cut her<br />
            breathing espousing my pain<br />
            sweeping my highs undercover<br />
            i been sleep and lost count of the days<br />
            leap for me, bound for my brothers<br />
            squeak past the scythe for the day<br />
            receiving the crown from my mother<br />
            beacon out of speakers sound like grief in front of town hall<br />
            a proud loud lost ass nigga afraid to sound off<br />
            now you gotta hear about how much the bubble down cost<br />
            and you gotta hear about the trouble loving brown has brought<br />
            numbers on mental healthcare<br />
            blunders on my skin it&rsquo;s scraped and bitten singed by hellflare<br />
            known since elementary they building a hell meant for me<br />
            niggas couldn&rsquo;t tip me off my balance we got strength<br />
            know these niggas love comparisons but baby i ain&rsquo;t him<br />
            these niggas also loving hesitance i hate the standing still<br />
            but i&rsquo;m still standing still will brandish iron fist<br />
            real manic, still will manage rocking ship<br />
            setting low standards in the throes of banishing my fears<br />
            when your ideal like feel like abandoning what&rsquo;s near<br />
            to your chest plate i got rest ranging in my ears<br />
            on my best day i got stress anchoring the kid<br />
            <br />
            gotta let the sun talk see it all clearer<br />
            several times i almost made my dawg a pallbearer<br />
            several times made a dartboard of my face but now the heart sores is sharpening my aim and now all serious<br />
            gotta keep y&rsquo;all near us<br />
            cause it&rsquo;s life in my belly, knife in my belly got my all leery<br />
            my stripes is a testament y&rsquo;alls is accessory all showy<br />
            steady making appearances, slave to your peers cause they all knowing<br />
            all growing handing off to reaper what we all sowing<br />
            life my greatest teacher and my preacher and my opponent<br />
            what you posed to think of yourself<br />
            when all the reasons for thinking you worth believing in is all going<br />
            but staying close enough just to hurl reminders at you<br />
            had to close the book not to be dishonest with you<br />
            made me open up now i&rsquo;m under fire listen<br />
            stained my opus underlined in underlying tension<br />
            verse-girl problems i couldn&rsquo;t make up<br />
            my brothers yeah i need them couldn&rsquo;t let them change up<br />
            damily having dreams that don&rsquo;t never wake up<br />
            i ain&rsquo;t plan to ever have to see my necklace hanged up<br />
            ayo first girl problems<br />

            headed back to the apple a return visit<br />
            but the urn empty<br />
            i ain&rsquo;t got the burn in me<br />
            i even turned tipsy<br />
            none of me&rsquo;s concerned honey berry singed my nerve endings<br />
            none of this confirmed and this the shit i put my word into<br />
            still on the curb but the curves different<br />
            moving on the same urges that got auntie home burst into<br />
            still the guy w the sutured innards<br />
            the sky is in my future sense it cumulonimbus whisperer<br />
            accumulate shit i sent for<br />
            assuming they don&rsquo;t hit me<br />
            getting the love i give more that make my muscles stiffen<br />
            zupa di mussels steaming<br />
            cruise w a couple demons<br />
            lucid enough to be made to look dumb by my allegiance<br />
            cap trapped in my schooling rap asking for time to spit<br />
            unwinding brain mind and consciousness<br />
            i want her grapevined around my shit the same time her countenance decays mine and pounds it in, that&rsquo;s how
            arousal is<br />
            silence at a premium<br />
            granddaddy still know my name he say it when i dream of him<br />
            forget it when his core is solid that ain&rsquo;t where the meaning is<br />
            folks just got too old and i was way too young to see it then<br />
            i!!! just hope this shit reaches him<br />
            it hurts not to believe in shit when all you need&rsquo;s belief and shit<br />
            it hurts not to believe in shit when all you need&rsquo;s belief and shit<br />
            serving back n forth w venus tryna stay serene admit<br />
            i&rsquo;m nervous racket borne w lesions slipping through the sleekest grip<br />
            can&rsquo;t wait until my raps is more than stashes for my secrets<br />
            can&rsquo;t wait till this casanova complex bring me peace<br />
            can&rsquo;t wait until this master rapping finally reap some decent ends<br />
            got a degree in hearing &lsquo;where do the secrets end&rsquo;<br />
            gotta appease appearances spirit been leaning in this rap shit<br />
            i kneel to it annealed in my attachment<br />
            my craft is a crapshoot<br />
            i bask cause i&rsquo;m a natural<br />
            i clash w my antagonist<br />
            i laugh: they think this battles new<br />
            i had failed off what i had to see<br />
            got the fuck up<br />
            brush my self off cursing gravity<br />
            burning rubber to preserve my burnt anatomy my house a thousand miles for me i never felt more home<br />
            until today i never felt overgrown<br />
            the second step is to accept that shit ain&rsquo;t goin wrong<br />
            these niggas wilted mavi never stopped growing homes<br />
            stopped growing
